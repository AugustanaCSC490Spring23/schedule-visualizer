## 🤯 Inspiration

Our Computer Science Department Chair, Dr. Stacy Rodman want to use the student's schedule and visualize it on a calendar view

![Schedule Table](https://github.com/tthuwng/schedule-visualizer/blob/develop/assets/schedule-table.png)

So we build a software to do that using Java FX.

## 🧐 What it does
Our team wanted to build a fully functional courses schedule app that helps students and falcuty easily manage and visualize the courses and make better decisions. 

With Schedule Visualizer, you can:
- Add courses through copy-paste plain text or intuitive form
- Add and manage multiple courses at a time
- Visualize courses on an interactive calendar view
- View the schedule through Day, Week, Month, or Year View
- Add, edit, and remove courses as well as events directly on the calendar

## 🥸 How we built it

- JavaFX using Eclipse as or main IDE
- CSS for styling the app
- Apply OOP and Java we've learned during the courses
- JUnit for unit testing

## 😅 Challenges we ran into

- JavaFX is limited in capabilities, especially design. So we have to customized most of the interface to make it looks nice and elegant 
- CalendarFX is almost impossible to customize functionalities and import to our project
- s c o p e is tough because we have so many things to build in minds

## 😊Accomplishments that we're proud of

- We have a great team that can work smoothly together
- Build a decent application that is usable

## 🤔 What we learned

- Aiming for ambitious projects is terrifying but feels good
- The importance of having a good teammates to work on something big. 

## 😤 What's next for Schedule Visualizer
Implementation in the real world! We aim to continue developing this to push out to real users with more features
We would love to learn more about new technologies and work with users (students, falcuty) from different backgrounds to understand more about their problems.
